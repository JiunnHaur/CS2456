Source file:
    warmup.c
Executable:
    t_switch

To compile the file just use "make" at local directory.


There are two pipes. One from parent to child let us name it p_to_c, the other from child to parent, let us name it c_to_p.
The parent will write to p_to_c and read from c_to_p.
The child will write to c_to_p and read from p_to_c. 

First we spawn a thread using pthread_create();.

Then we do multiple read and write to the pipe we take down the time as well. 
Because we are doing multiple iterations here, we can take the start time and end time of all these iterations. 

The error of the final answer will be reduced with the increasing of the iteration time.
