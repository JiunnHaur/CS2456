1. for the switch time. let assume the cpu work on parent first, after the parent write to the pipe1, parent is blocked at read();
then the child can read out the content from pipe1.

the context switch from parent from child has to be finished before this child process can read anything from the pipe1.

name the time when parent finished write the message to pipe1 p_write_finish; the time when child is read to read from the pipe1 c_read_ready

therefore, the first context time should be the differece of these two times

time_context_switch = p_write_finish - c_read_ready;

This same context process happens when the parent reads back msg from the child a second time.

flags like O_CREAT, O_RDWR are defined in <fcntl.h> library

errno and strerrno(errno) is defnied in <errno.h> library
