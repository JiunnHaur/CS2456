Names of executable file
min_func    //for miniumn function call
min_syscall // For minimum system call
switch  //For the context switch time

Individual part
Problem #1:
    source path: /min_func/min_func.c
    executable file name: min_func
    Explanation: foo() is an empty function that does nothing. It is run 1000 times. The total time for this 1000 iteration was measured.

Problem #2:
    source path: /min_syscall/min_syscal.c
    excutable file name: min_syscall
    Explantion: getpid() is run 1000 times. Total time for this 1000 iteration was taken down. 

Problem #3:
    source path: /switch/switch.c
    excutable file name: switch
    Explanation: Creats two pipes. One from parent to child the other from child to parent. Time interval is measured when parent is done writing and child is done reading. There is another context switch happening when child is done writing and parent is done reading. 
    I measured the entire process, which includes two read/write operation.Then therefore my total time is divided by 2 before it is sent to the terminal.
